\title{Calculate Protein Oxidation from Urea}
\usage{
calc_protein_oxidation(
  urea_loss,
  exercise_duration = 120,
  conversion_factor = 2.915,
  id_col = "id"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{urea_loss}{A data frame from calc_urea_loss (or with urea_mass_loss column)}

\item{exercise_duration}{Exercise duration in minutes (default: 120)}

\item{conversion_factor}{Protein/urea conversion factor (default: 2.915)}

\item{id_col}{Name of the ID column}
}
\value{
A tibble with protein oxidation rates (g/min)
}
\description{
Estimate protein oxidation rate from total urea nitrogen loss.
Uses the conversion factor of 2.915 (grams protein per gram urea).
}
\details{
The conversion factor of 2.915 is derived from the work of Telmosse (2022),
which states that 1 gram of urea excreted is equivalent to 0.343 grams of protein oxidized.
This value is based on the protein formula (\code{C89H148.5O32N23.5}) described in
Institute of Medicine (2005).
\itemize{
\item Nitrogen content of proteins (~16\%)
\item Nitrogen content of urea (46.6\%)
\item Complete oxidation of amino acids
}

protein_ox = urea_mass * 2.915 / exercise_duration
}
