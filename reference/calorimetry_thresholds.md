# Calorimetry Validation Thresholds

Default physiological thresholds for validating indirect calorimetry
data. Values based on exercise physiology literature.

## Usage

``` r
calorimetry_thresholds
```

## Format

A named list with thresholds for each variable:

- vo2:

  VO2 thresholds in L/min (min, max, typical_min, typical_max)

- vco2:

  VCO2 thresholds in L/min

- rer:

  Respiratory Exchange Ratio thresholds

- cho_oxidation:

  CHO oxidation rate thresholds in g/min

- fat_oxidation:

  Fat oxidation rate thresholds in g/min

- protein_oxidation:

  Protein oxidation rate thresholds in g/min
